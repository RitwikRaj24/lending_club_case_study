# Lending Club Case Study
### by Ritwik Raj and Ritesh Kumar

## Objective 
Our objective is to leverage historical loan data to identify patterns that predict loan default risk . By developing an understanding of the key factors that influence default , we can significantly improve our risk assessment strategies . 

The path includes analysing applicants and loan attributes , aiming to uncover hidden trends that differentiate between responsible borrowers and those likely to default. Equipped with these insights, we can make data-driven decisions regarding loan approvals, terms, and portfolio management.

## General Information:
### Project General Information
This project aims to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify the factors that influence loan defaults in an online loan marketplace. The company provides various loans, and identifying risky applicants is crucial to minimizing financial losses.
### Project Background:
The background of this project revolves around the need to manage and mitigate the risk of loan defaults in an online lending platform. By analyzing historical loan data, the project aims to identify key indicators of default and develop strategies to reduce credit losses. The insights gained from this analysis will help the company make informed decisions, improve its loan approval process, and enhance its risk management practices.
### Business probem which we are trying to solve:
The business problem at the core of this project is to minimize the risk of financial losses due to loan defaults by identifying and understanding the factors that contribute to borrower risk. By leveraging Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling, the company aims to improve its risk assessment capabilities, optimize its loan portfolio, and enhance overall profitability.
### Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains historical loan data from a consumer finance company that specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. The dataset includes information about past loan applicants, their profiles, loan characteristics, and the loan repayment status. This data is crucial for analyzing patterns and identifying factors that contribute to loan defaults.
### Key Characteristics of the Dataset:
- Time Period: The dataset covers loans issued over the time period from 2007 to 2011.
- Loan Information: Includes details such as loan amount, interest rate, installment amount, loan term, and loan purpose.
