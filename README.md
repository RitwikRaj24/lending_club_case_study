# Lending Club Case Study
### by Ritwik Raj and Ritesh Kumar

## Objective 
Our objective is to leverage historical loan data to identify patterns that predict loan default risk . By developing an understanding of the key factors that influence default , we can significantly improve our risk assessment strategies . 

The path includes analysing applicants and loan attributes , aiming to uncover hidden trends that differentiate between responsible borrowers and those likely to default.  Equipped with these insights, we can make data-driven decisions regarding loan approvals, terms, and portfolio management.
